Lecture Transcript Generator is a tool designed to process raw lecture notes and structure them into well-organized, readable transcripts. This project leverages Google AI Studio and the Gemini 1.5 Flash API to generate high-quality structured transcripts from educational content.
Features:
AI-Powered Prompt Engineering: Uses Google AI Studio to design and refine structured prompts.

Text-based Processing: Converts unstructured lecture notes into formatted transcripts.

 Automatic Formatting: Applies consistent headings, bullet points, and structuring.

Optimized API Parameters: Utilizes Gemini 1.5 Flash with optimized temperature and chunking strategies.

 Batch Processing Support: Handles large input texts efficiently.

Fast & Reliable: Ensures quick text processing through refined API calls.
Prompt Design & Optimization:

The process of designing an effective prompt began with the use of Google AI Studio, which provided a dedicated environment to test and optimize the prompt design for the Gemini 1.5 Flash model. The interface allowed iterative refinements and parameter adjustments, ensuring the prompts produced clear, structured, and logical outputs.

Structured Prompting: The initial prompt was designed to create a structured transcript for educational lectures, divided into sections such as an introduction, detailed core concepts, practical examples, and a conclusion.

Iterative Refinement: Adjustments were made through specific directives and repeated testing across different topics.

Challenges Faced and Solutions:

Repetitive opening sentences in outputs → Modified the prompt in Google AI Studio to include clear conditions restricting introductory language to the first sentence only. Implemented post-processing techniques to filter residual issues.

Misuse of API parameters (e.g., temperature settings) → Consulted Gemini API documentation and used testing results from Google AI Studio to apply the appropriate syntax and parameter combinations.
Future Improvements:
Enhanced NLP Features: Improve keyword extraction and summarization.

PDF/Markdown Export: Provide multiple output format options.

Customizable Formatting: Allow users to define their own structuring rules.
